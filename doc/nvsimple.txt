1. ABOUT ~
                                                        *nvsimple-about*

nvSimple is a poor man's imitation of Notational Velocity or nvALT.

nvSimple is a way to maintain a flat directory of plain text notes with easy
full text search, and quick access.

nvSimple is based on an idea by Ellen Gummesson.

nvSimple makes use of |vimgrep| and the |quickfix| list.

2. INSTALLING ~
                                                        *nvsimple-install*

The easiest way is to point Pathogen or Vundle at the git repository on
GitHub at https://github.com/scrosland/nvsimple.

For example, using Vundle (https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) add this
to your .vimrc: >

    Bundle 'scrosland/nvsimple.vim'


3. CONFIGURING ~
                                                        *nvsimple-configure*
                                                        *nvsimple-options*

By default nvSimple will assume that your notes are stored in text files with
a '.txt' extension in $USERPROFILE\Documents\notes on Windows,
and in $HOME/notes on all other platforms.

nvSimple knows how to start NERDTree or netrw to browse the notes directory.

All of this can be changed through the nvSimple configuration variables:

    |nvsimple_browser|..............Configure the directory browser.
    |nvsimple_default_extension|....Set the default note file extension.
    |nvsimple_notes_directory|......Set the notes directory path.

                                                        *'g:nvsimple_browser'*

Use this option to configure which command is called to browse the notes
folder. By default this is set to :NERDTree if the NERDTree plugin is
installed, otherwise this is defaults to |:Explore|. This must include the
leading ':' on the command name.
>
    let g:nvsimple_browse = ':Explore'
<

                                              *'g:nvsimple_default_extension'*

Use this option to configure the default extension for a notes file.
By default this is set to '.txt'. This must include the period ('.').
>
    let g:nvsimple_default_extension = '.txt'
<

                                              *'g:nvsimple_notes_directory'*

Use this option to set the location of the directory containing your notes.
The default for this option depends on platform:
  - on Windows               $USERPROFILE\Documents\notes
  - on all other platforms   $HOME/notes.
>
    let g:nvsimple_notes_directory = '$HOME/notes'
<


4. USING ~
                                                        *nvsimple-using*

The interface to nvSimple is two commands, |:Nv| and |:Nvopen|.

    |:Nv|.........................Search or browse for a notes file.
    |:Nvopen|.....................Edit or create a notes file.

                                                        *nvsimple-Nv* *:Nv*
:Nv [pattern]

    Search or browse for notes.

    If [pattern] is not supplied, the command prompts for a search pattern. At
    the prompt, either enter a |vimgrep| style pattern, or press return to open
    a directory browser in your notes directory, as configured with
    |'g:nvsimple_notes_directory'|.

    Searches all notes for [pattern] using |vimgrep|, and then opens the
    results in the |quickfix| window via the |copen| command. The search will
    include all notes files whether they have the default extension or not.


                                                        *nvsimple-Nvopen*
                                                        *:Nvopen*
:Nvopen
:Nvopen a-new-note
:Nvopen a-new-todo.taskpaper

    Opens an existing note or creates a new note.

    If a name is not supplied, the command prompts for the name.

    If the name does not include an extension (e.g. '.txt') the default file
    extension will be appended from the |'g:nvsimple_default_extension'|
    option. Names may include spaces.


5. API ~
                                                        *nvsimple-api*

If you wish to declare your own commands or call nvSimple from vimscript
functions there is a public API.

    |:Nvopen|.....................Edit or create a notes file.

                                                        *nvsimple#browse*
>
    nvsimple#browse()

Open a directory browser in the configured notes directory.

                                                        *nvsimple#search*
>
    nvsimple#search(pattern)

Search for a |vimgrep| {pattern} in the notes files. If pattern is empty the
function will prompt the user: if the pattern is still empty, opens a browser.

                                                        *nvsimple#open*
>
    nvsimple#open(bang, filename)

Open or create a note with {filename}. {bang} is <q-bang> (see |bang|).
See |Nvopen| for further details.


6. CHANGELOG ~
                                                        *nvsimple-changelog*

0.1.3   2014-01-18

    - Correct the docs to match the repository name change.
    - Change to :Explore instead of :Sexplore as it's a little more obvious
      for the user.

0.1.2   2014-01-18

    - Expand and escape pathnames to cope with meta characters.
    - Check whether g:nvsimple_notes_directory exists, report error if not.

0.1.1   2014-01-16

    - Initial version.
